Place the font files in this folder with the exact names used in pubspec.yaml:

- IRANYekan-Regular.ttf
- IRANYekan-Medium.ttf
- IRANYekan-Bold.ttf
- Poppins-Regular.ttf
- Poppins-Medium.ttf
- Poppins-Bold.ttf

If you have files named differently (e.g., with prefix 'A '), rename them to match.
After placing files run:

flutter pub get

Then rebuild the app (flutter run) to see the fonts applied.
